##Technical Background
I don't have a ton of programming experience besides the basics in Java, Python, and C. I do have a lot of experience in the field of cybersecurity, having been studying cyber since my junior year of high school. I primarily like to focus with risk and compliance, but the recent "AI boom" has gotten me very interested in AI and cloud security.
